A Raspberry Pi 5 GPS Time Disciplined Stratum 1 Time Server with PTP and Realtime Kernel.

WARNING: This project comes without warranty, express or implied. This project is pedantic, and optimises very low-level system files. If you are not comfortable managing a linux system, I would not recommend that you embark on this project! While I am happy to answer questions (and am very much open to suggestions too), I will not troubleshoot your setup for you.

I have laid out the methods I have used in the wiki secton. Feel free to pick and choose what you implement. Again, I cannot / will not troubleshoot a broken system for you. 

The repo itself contains the individual confifuration files that I have used, including systemd unit files etc. They are stored in the same folder hierarchy that is found on the system. The relevance of each file can be found throughout the wiki.

You know what they say though; 'time flies when you're having fun!'
